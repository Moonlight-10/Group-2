        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is being created for CTECH 3350 in the UTA Fall 2020 semester to demonstrate the creative brief stage of the website redesign process.</p>
        <p>We chose to work with Thirstyâ€™s Tavern to improve a way to showcase their goals as a business on their website as well as limit the amount of information on their website to not overwhelm customers. </p>
        <p>In addition, the business needs reconfiguration for modern SEO and design standards. The website provides enough information through its copy and source code to give our team a sufficient base to perform analysis.</p>
