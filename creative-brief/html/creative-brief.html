        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is being created for CTECH 3350 in the UTA Fall 2020 semester to demonstrate the creative brief stage of the website redesign process.</p>
        <p>We chose to work with Thirsty’s Tavern to improve a way to showcase their goals as a business on their website as well as limit the amount of information on their website to not overwhelm customers. </p>
        <p>In addition, the business needs reconfiguration for modern SEO and design standards. The website provides enough information through its copy and source code to give our team a sufficient base to perform analysis.</p>

        <h2>Background Summary</h2>
        <p>The client, Thomas Hager, is a 54-year-old man living in the mid-south area of New York state. Hager is the owner of Thirtsy's Tavern, a local Binghamton sports bar that has enjoyed over four decades of success.</p>

        <p>The restaurant/bar serves the area with both dine-in and take-out bar fare including wings, burgers, and sandwiches. Strengths of the business include their celebrated selection of tap beers, media setups, and friendly service also makes Thirsty's
            a popular spot for both football events and catered parties. </p>

        <p>The bar receives excellent reviews on popular user-rating platforms including Google, Facebook, and Yelp. Their food is simple, appealing, and is as popular for take-out as it is for dine-in. The bar is known for its diverse, talented pool of
            live musicians. The online presence of Thirsty's is very active, keeping engagement and business up even in the midst of a pandemic that has been largely destructive for bars and small businesses. </p>

        <p>Weaknesses include the business' website itself, which is in some need of redesign. The SEO includes strange keywords, unoptimized assets/ images, and bloated text blurbs that make the site difficult to find and navigate. Photos consist of older
            mobile shots and stock images that need an update. Additionally, although their online presence is active, customer engagement via review is non-existent. </p>

        <p>There are ample opportunities for improvement in the bar's marketing. Customer engagement through review replies being the most immediate and cost-effective. New photos of popular dishes and the bar itself are also a low-risk, high-reward opportunity
            for brand engagement. Setting up a GrubHub, Postmates, or UberEats special may also drive more customers to order online when they may otherwise be staying inside during quarantine.</p>

        <p>The restaurant industry is highly competitive and prone to failure. Thirsty's long-term standing as a local landmark and reliable service has kept it healthy for decades, but the threat of larger, corporate-owned restaurants still stands. Thirsty's
            needs to revamp its online presence and reconfigure business towards take-out and delivery, specifically, in order to keep enjoying the success it has had thus far.</p>

        <h2>Target User Insight Information</h2>
        <p>The general clientele of Thirsty's Tavern ranges from mid-20's to early-50's men and women. The majority appear to be lower-to-middle class Caucasian men. Most users appear to find the website on mobile phones as opposed to desktops. Pre-2020
            customers included the atmosphere and live entertainment as major draws to the business, while current reviews focus almost exclusively on the food.</p>
        <h2>Brand Attributes, Promise, and Mission</h2>
        <p>Thirsty's Tavern prides itself on being a “no-frills” sports bar with friendly staff, great food, and a fun, low-stress atmosphere. </p>
        <h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>
        <p>Though located in one of New York's lower tourist-traffic areas, Binghamton is home to many popular local bars and restaurants. Thirsty's rates mid-to-low on search results for local bars and significantly lower on searches for local restaurants.
            This, in addition to a variety of “safe”, corporate-owned restaurants in the area, pose a threat to the business if the trend continues downward.</p>
        <h2>Business Objectives / Success Criteria</h2>
        <p>Our objective in redesigning the website for Thirsty's Tavern is to completely reconfigure the existing layout and SEO to meet developing industry standards. The website must be simplified for mobile devices, easily found on popular search engines,
            and easy to browse while encouraging engagement.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="content-box">
        <h2>Testing Requirements / Measurements of Success</h2>
        <p>The website has an existing Google Analytics tracker that we can utilize to test and measure customer engagement. If delivery options are added, clicks can be tracked to view how many customers prefer to order online, and which of those customers
            are more likely to choose take-out or delivery options. Success will be measured based on the CTR, comparing the amount of visits that led to engagement to visits that yielded no result.</p>
        <h2>Creative Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            It is in the company's best interest that we research competing sports bar-adjacent businesses that rend well in search results to measure their level of dedication to mobile-friendly sites and services. Do these websites offer delivery, are they easy
            to navigate on a mobile device, is there a call-to-action above the fold, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Social media engagement will be widely encouraged via icons and links to the business' respective outlets, including Yelp, Facebook, Google, and any other available platforms. </p>
        <h2>Functionality &amp; Technical Specifications</h2>
        <p>Recommend importing existing content in the website to a shared cloud folder and migrating the website to WordPress. This will streamline the redesign process as copy, photos, and design are integrated into the new layout. Additionally, WordPress
            will allow the business to integrate tracking, engagement, and payment options more easily than if left in the current format.</p>
        <h2>Contribution &amp; Approval Process</h2>
        <p>The client is expected to provide new photos and any new info that is deemed relevant, but is not made apparent in the current copy. The point of contact may be either the owner or any staff member to whom he delegates all creative control. Using
            the information we gather from the client, we will enter a 2-week turnaround to submit the first draft of the redesigned website. If the website is approved as-is, the domain will be attached to the new site and all dead links redirected.
            If more changes are needed, the client must provide instruction and we will enter 1-week turnaround to submit the finalized site. </p>
        <h2>Timelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial interview </li>
            <li>Week 1 - Site migration and initial restructure</li>
            <li>Second meeting</li>
            <li>Finalize changes and publish website</li>
        </ul>
