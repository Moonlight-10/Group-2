                        <ul>
                            <li>The layout of the website needs the content broken into smaller parts.</li>
                            <li>The overall design is not eye-catching, needs improvement in flow, color, and images.</li>
                            <li>Search engine keywords should align with potential customers’ searches.</li>

                            <li>Images are often too low-resolution or stock photos. Recommend taking new photos at a higher quality, and adding pictures of the more popular items on the menu.</li>
                            <li>Images need to be up to date to show current tavern and food items.</li>
                            <li>Images should give the website a colorful, eye-catching appearance.</li>

                            <li>The website has no engagement tools for customers. Recommend adding options to book, review, or follow on social media.</li>
                            <li>Online reviews are not responded to, needs active customer interaction to increase brand awareness.</li>
                            <li>Only one social media platform on the website, which limits interaction with customers. Adding an additional 2-3 should drive customers to stay interested.</li>

                            <li>COVID Regulations will limit the capacity of dine-in eating and drinking. Recommend pushing take-out and possible delivery options.</li>
                            <li>Thorough training on sanitation for staff members and cleaning supplies to keep everyone safe.</li>
                            <li>More in-depth cleaning processes will encourage wary potential customers to visit for in-house dining and drinks.</li>
